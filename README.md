This www.OpenPrescribing.net repository seeks to answer "What are the most commonly prescribed medicines?" All the code is available for inspection and re-use and we have written a blog post on the [Top 10 medicines in the NHS for 2019](https://ebmdatalab.net/top10-medicines-2019/) on our DataLab website. Jupyter notebook analysis can be found in notebook folder.

If you have any questions or comments please feel free to get in touch via feedback@openprescribing.net or on Twitter @openprescribing





# If you would like to reuse EBM DataLab's skeleton notebook environment the following information will be helpful

![status](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/<repo>/workflows/Notebook%20checks/badge.svg)

## Getting started with this skeleton project

This is a skeleton project for creating a reproducible, cross-platform
analysis notebook, using Docker.  It also includes:

* configuration for `jupytext`, to support easier code review
* cross-platform startup scripts
* best practice folder structure and documentation

Developers and analysts using this skeleton for new development should
refer to [`DEVELOPERS.md`](DEVELOPERS.md) for instructions on getting
started.  Update this `README.md` so it is a suitable introduction to
your project.

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/<repo>/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

To do development work, you'll need to set up a local jupyter server
and git repository - see `DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.

## How to cite

XXX Please change to either a paper (if published) or the repo. You may find it helpful to use Zenodo DOI (see `DEVELOPERS.md` for further information)
